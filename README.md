# üêç Python Projects Playground

> My hands-on Python learning journey ‚Äî aiming to build projects from **beginner** to **advanced** levels, starting with Python fundamentals and integrating **CI/CD** for every step.

## üìò About

This repository is a growing collection of **beginner-friendly Python projects**.  
Each project focuses on improving programming logic, code readability, and hands-on practice.  
As I progress, I‚Äôll explore **Data Science** and **Machine Learning** in dedicated future repositories.

> üéØ Goal: Learn Python by **building**, **testing**, and **automating** real-world projects.
